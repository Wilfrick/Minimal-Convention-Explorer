# Minimal Convention Explorer
This is a codebase for a minimal Hanabi convention simulator. 

The convention that this implements is detailed [here][../Minimal Convention.md]. This document assumes you already know how the game of Hanabi works, but if you do not there is a good reference [here][https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/rules.md].
