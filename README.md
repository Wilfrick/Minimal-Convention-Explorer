# Minimal Convention Explorer
This is a tool to help understand different ways of played the cooperative card game Hanabi. For the uninitated, a good reference on how the game itself is played can be found [here](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/rules.md).

Usually players that want to win will introduce new rules and ideas that they choose to follow during a game and we call that system the "convention" that those players are using. I have played with several groups of people that followed different conventions and I wanted a way to compare and contrast those different systems to see which (if any) have a tangible benifit over any others. For this reason I have created this "Minimal Convention Explorer", a tool designed to simulate a large number of hanabi games with a given convention so as to assess how good that convention is at winning the game (measured through metrics like average score or proportion of perfect games).

This is the codebase for a this project.

The convention that is currently implemented is detailed [here](../main/Minimal%20Convention.md). Please note that this convention document assumes you already know how the game of Hanabi works, but if you need a refresher [this is a good place to start](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/rules.md).
